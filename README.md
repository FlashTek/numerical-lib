# university-numerical
Implementation of various different numerical methods for solving PDEs. Furthermore, solutions of more complex scenarios of heat transform are examined.


## lib
Contains a set of often used functions and implementations useful solving PDEs. Futhermore, additional discrete numerical methods are included.

## libTest
Tests to test the functions implemented in the `lib`.

## cwr
Exmample usage of the `lib` to examine the bifurcation of a chaotic, coupled oscillators.

## NumStrm
Exmplae usage of the `lib` to solve a complex scenario of heat transportation on `2D` using the `lib`. Implicit and explicit methods are used and compared.
